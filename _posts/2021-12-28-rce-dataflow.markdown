title:  "Remote Code Execution in Google Cloud Dataflow"
date:   2021-12-28 06:00:00 +0000
---

Earlier this year, I was debugging an error in Dataflow, and as part of that process, I dropped into the worker node via SSH and began to look around. Prior to that experience I hadn't thought much about what was happening on the worker node, so I made a mental reminder to dig into Dataflow as a possible exploit vector into Google Cloud. Later that week, I spun up Dataflow in my personal Google Cloud account and started digging.

After some work, I identified an unauthenticated Java JMX service running on Dataflow nodes that, under certain circumstances, would be exposed to the Internet allowing unauthenticated remote code execution as root, in an unprivileged container, on the target Dataflow node. This was reported to Google under their [vulnerability reward program](https://bughunters.google.com/about/rules/6625378258649088) (VRP) for Google Cloud. Ultimately, Google paid me $3133.70 as a reward for reporting the vulnerability.

## Dataflow Overview
Dataflow is a [runner](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/capability-matrix/) for Apache Beam.  It allows a developer to write code using [Apache Beam's SDK](https://beam.apache.org/) and run it on Dataflow. Dataflow then handles things like consuming and windowing data, spinning up worker nodes, and moving data bundles between nodes for processing. This allows developers to focus less on how to scale their code. For Apache Beam, there is an SDK for Java, Python, and Go with Java being the primary SDK which has the most support.

When a Dataflow job is launched, what basically happens is that Google spins up VMs using [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute) with a [managed instance group](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups). This uses a VM [instance template](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-templates) that Google maintains. Google describes [Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow) as a "fully managed data processing service". As a customer, the worker nodes should fall into at least the PaaS bucket of Google's [shared responsibility model](https://cloud.google.com/security/incident-response#how_google_helps_secure_customer_data) for cloud security. Customers are responsible for deploying the Dataflow jobs, but the customer shouldn't have to worry about securing the worker nodes.

## The Kubelet as a Target
When I first began researching Dataflow workers as a possible target, I was expecting that I would find a weakness in the kubelet configuration. Looking at Dataflow logs, I had noticed that there was a Kubernetes kubelet running. Nowhere in the documentation does it explain that Dataflow runs on GKE or otherwise use Kubernetes, so this was interesting.

```
root         698  2.0  0.5 1478308 81128 ?       Ssl  05:33   0:36 /usr/bin/kubelet --manifest-url=http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/attributes/google-container-manifest --manifest-
url-header=Metadata-Flavor:Google --pod-manifest-path=/etc/kubernetes/manifests --eviction-hard= --image-gc-high-threshold=100
```

When initially digging in, I did find that the Kubelet is not using authentication, so I felt this was the target. Looking deeper, the kubelet here is being used locally only. Additionally, the Kubelet port has a local firewall on the node that the user could not accidentally disable. The kubelet is being used to read a config file using the `--manifest-url` option. This makes use of the kubelet to simply start a set of containers on the Dataflow node. It turns out to be an interesting and unexpected use of the kubelet, but there was basically no real attack surface against the kubelet.

## Interesting Ports
Looking at the firewall, there are some interesting ports being opened. I cross-referenced this with ports that were actually listening on the network.

```

## Exposing Java JMX
After probing more of the Dataflow node, I identified port 5555 as a Java JMX port. I started looking to see how it was configured. Again, my assumption here was that Google would be generating some PKI to manage these on a per-instance group basis or similar. Since I could just look at the VM directly, I looked at the Java processes running. 

```

```

The main Java process had the following command line flags which seemed to indicate these would be easy to exploit, if exposed.

```
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false 
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=5555 
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port=5555 
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote=true
```

At this point, I know the Java JMX port is open on the node, has no authentication enabled, and does not use TLS. The Java process, however is being run within a container. The container in question here ended up being `gcr.io/cloud-dataflow/v1beta3/beam-java11-streaming` and it was not run as a privileged container.

```

The container, however, was using host networking. This meant that although it was unprivileged (basically meaning it cannot access the host VM as the root user), it could still access the host VM's metadata service. This allows access to generate signed JWT tokens which can be used to access other GCP services.

Unauthenticated JMX should not be used in production and is easily exploited. Oracle [warns of this](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/management/monitoring-and-management-using-jmx-technology.html#GUID-9ED79A3B-B710-4B89-A64D-5C566A160A95) in the Java documentation. Exposed internally or externally, this may allow an attacker to access the Dataflow node and the GCP service account assigned to the Dataflow job. By default, this is the [default compute service account](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts#default_service_account), which has the Editor role on the entire GCP project by default.

### Default Internal Traffic Firewall Rule
To attack the JMX port, my goal was to make this work from the Internet. Exploitability from an internal system is a risk and interesting, but unlikely to be valued or prioritized by Google. By default, Google Cloud adds a firewall rule named `default-allow-internal` to a project's [firewall](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewalls#more_rules_default_vpc) created via the Cloud Console. This rule allows nearly all traffic to pass between nodes on the VPC. So it was pretty clear that any internal VPC hosts, and possibly other hosts connected to the VPC through [Cloud Interconnect](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect), may also be subject to this rule and would be able to exploit this vulnerability. This would allow internal hosts to pivot and gain service account access in the Google Cloud project.

### External IPs by Default
For external access, Dataflow nodes are assigned an external IP by default. This address is subject to firewall controls, and no default rules allow ingress traffic from the Internet. This is where things get somewhat implementation specific. While Google describes Dataflow as "fully managed" and I feel a PaaS or SaaS service's security should not be impacted by a customer's VPC firewall, the Dataflow worker nodes are directly impacted. The vulnerability is that an unauthenticated Java JMX port is exposed on the network interface of the Dataflow worker node. This is entirely controlled by Google, including any local firewalls, via their instance template. The customer, however, does have the ability to mitigate this by either limiting or blocking all traffic to that port using the GCP VPC firewall. The customer would need to know that this firewall rule is required.

At this point, my expectation is that some GCP customers likely have overly permissive firewall rules that may allow Dataflow nodes to be exposed on the Internet. I performed a passive scan to identify port 5555 being open in US-based GCP [regions](https://www.gstatic.com/ipranges/cloud.json). This produced over 2200 results leading me to believe that this indeed does affect real customers.

## Mitigation
To mitigate this and potentially other vulnerabilities in the Dataflow nodes, my recommendation is a tag-based firewall rule applied to the VPC to block all traffic. This can target the `dataflow` network tag, which is configured by default for Dataflow nodes.

## Walk-through to Get RCE
The following is a walk-through of the process which was used at the time to gain remote code execution.

### Setup
Requirements:

- Google Cloud Project
  - Billing must be enabled
  - Compute Engine API must be enabled
  - Pub/Sub API must be enabled
  
Create a Google Cloud project. Here, I've created mine called `gcp-dataflow-rce-poc` and have since deleted this project.

![](/images/rce-dataflow/create-project.png)

The Billing and Compute Engine APIs must be enabled. A default VPC is created when the Compute Engine API is enabled. The Pub/Sub API should automatically be enabled for most users when accessing Pub/Sub via the Cloud Console.

### Simulate an Overly Permissive Firewall
Here, I've added a bad firewall rule to my VPC. This is used to simulate an overly permissive firewall rule allowing access TCP ports 80-8080 from all hosts.
![](/images/rce-dataflow/dataflow-firewall.png)

### Create Examples Sources and Sinks
For this example, I use a Dataflow streaming job. This is what I'm personally most familiar with. To use this, we need some example data sources and data sinks. So to do this, I create two example Pub/Sub topics.
![](/images/rce-dataflow/pubsub-topics.png)
![](/images/rce-dataflow/pubsub-subscriptions.png)

### Create Temporary Storage for Dataflow
Dataflow requires temporary storage. To accommodate this, I created a Google Storage bucket.
![](/images/rce-dataflow/cloud-storage.png)

### Run Example Dataflow Job
I select the Pub/Sub to Pub/Sub template and provide the previously created Pub/Sub source and sink as well as the temporary storage. Default IAM project permissions should work.
![](/images/rce-dataflow/dataflow-create-job.png)

Once the job is started, it can be seen in the Dataflow jobs page. The VM nodes will also be visible in the Compute Engine console. By default, there is a public IP assigned and access to this is governed by the VPC firewall.
![](/images/rce-dataflow/dataflow-nodes.png)

### Attacking the Dataflow Node
First, let's confirm we do indeed have access to the JMX port on the worker node.

```
mike@enemabot:~$ nmap -p 5555 -Pn 35.226.73.31
Starting Nmap 7.80SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-03-14 05:36 UTC
Nmap scan report for 31.73.226.35.bc.googleusercontent.com (35.226.73.31)
Host is up (0.029s latency).

PORT     STATE SERVICE
5555/tcp open  freeciv

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.08 seconds
```

So I know the worker node is indeed accessible from the Internet. The next step is to exploit the exposed JMX port. The easiest way I found was to use Metasploit, which has an exploit just for this vulnerability and worked well.

```

```

It's not abundantly clear, but the shell is on the Dataflow worker node and inside an unprivileged container. But that doesn't mean this is useful from an attacker point of view, yet.

From here, I check to see if there is any access to the GCP project. I check the GCP metadata service for a service account assigned to the node and exposed to the container.

```
curl -s "http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/email" -H "Metadata-Flavor: Google"
434222506484-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
```

It returns the Compute Engine default service account (as expected). As the default compute engine service account, it has the Editor role and significant access to the GCP project. It is likely that many customers continue to keep the default IAM role assigned to the default compute engine service account. Regardless, this shows that whatever service account is assigned to the Dataflow node, this container can access the metadata service and obtain the access / IAM permissions assigned to that service account. This can be used to attack the customer's GCP services.
